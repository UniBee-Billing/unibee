## Community driven
UniBee was born from real-world SaaS billing challenges. Our journey through WooCommerce, WHMCS, and KillBill taught us that existing solutions were either inflexible, expensive, or couldn‚Äôt scale with growing businesses.

After years of struggling with closed systems, escalating costs, and limited customization, we realized the SaaS world needed a better solution. We combined our hard-earned lessons with open-source principles to create UniBee ‚Äì a billing system that‚Äôs fair, flexible, and puts control back in the hands of businesses.
